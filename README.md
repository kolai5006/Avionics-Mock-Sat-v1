# Avionics-Mock-Sat-v1
First Repository For CSULB's SharkSat MockSat 

Disclaimer:
This is the first repository using github, through cubeide
ideally want to move a away from cube ide, and start using VS Code
to code and debug through there

This repository is practically temporary for now, until we find a permanent solution and learn how to setup.

also dont mind the name from ss_mock_v2 das what adam named it in cube ide
